Summary: The Super Competitive Arena project will use Pelican to manage the blog for development updates and key decisions.

In recent months, Super Competitive Arena (SCA) has been steadily growing in its design and definition. To maintain clear and up-to-date documentation on developments, we have decided to adopt **Pelican** as the platform for our dev blog.

### Why Pelican?
Pelican is a Python-based static blog generator that allows us to write our posts in **Markdown** or **reStructuredText**, maintaining full control over formatting and publishing. Thanks to its static nature, it ensures **high performance, security, and ease of distribution**.

### Dev Blog Objectives
Our blog will be the go-to resource for updates on:
- **New features** of the project.
- **Technical discussions and decisions** (smart contracts, gameplay, governance).
- **Tournament announcements** and infrastructure improvements.
- **Performance analysis** and reflections on system evolutions.

### Next Steps
We have already started transferring initial documentation and roadmaps to Pelican. In the coming days, we will publish the first detailed articles on the latest implementations, including updates on **decentralized governance**, **multi-guild tournament management**, and **smart contract optimizations on Optimism**.

If you are interested in closely following SCA's evolution, stay tuned: the blog will become an essential resource for understanding every aspect of development.

See you soon with more updates!
