Summary: After multiple trials and broken heads, the smart contract now successfully deploys on a local test chain. Next, we move on to comprehensive testing to ensure everything works as expected.

After countless iterations, debugging sessions, and conceptual rewrites, I’ve finally managed to **successfully deploy the smart contract for Super Competitive Arena (SCA) on a local test chain**. This marks a crucial milestone in the project, but the real challenge begins now: **testing**.

### Preparing for Rigorous Testing
Now that we have a deployed contract, we need to ensure that every function behaves correctly under different conditions. The following categories define our test coverage:

#### **1. Initialization Tests**
- ✅ Deploy the core contract and its facets.
- ✅ Verify the correct initialization of treasuries (creator, guilds, main tournament).
- ✅ Ensure administrative roles (owner, oracle, guild leaders) are properly assigned.

#### **2. NFT Functionality Tests**
- ✅ Mint the creator NFT upon the first deployment.
- ✅ Correct minting of guild NFTs.
- ✅ Minting new Champion NFTs upon governance approval.
- ✅ Ensuring proper association of NFTs with guilds.
- ✅ Transfer functionality validation.
- ✅ URI and metadata integrity tests.
- ✅ Burn functionality (if applicable).

#### **3. Governance Proposal Tests**
- ✅ Creating proposals for game rule updates.
- ✅ Proposing new NFT series.
- ✅ Submitting a proposal for tournament initiation.
- ✅ Modifying royalty distributions.
- ✅ Simulating voting and quorum requirements.
- ✅ Executing approved proposals.
- ✅ Handling rejected proposals properly.
- ✅ Weighting votes based on NFT types (Champions, Choices, Skins, etc.).

#### **4. Tournament Logic Tests**
- ✅ Creation and initiation of a guild tournament.
- ✅ Multi-guild tournament setup and launch.
- ✅ Execution of the main tournament.
- ✅ Player registration with fee payments.
- ✅ Refund process when a user exits before tournament start.
- ✅ Handling of tournaments failing to meet participant thresholds.
- ✅ Automatic closing and winner determination.
- ✅ Prize pool distribution verification.
- ✅ Tie scenario handling in the main tournament.
- ✅ Regeneration of Anima points and fee distribution (30% to creator, 70% to guild treasury).
- ✅ Ensuring the tournament mechanism prevents treasury depletion.

#### **5. Guild Treasury Tests**
- ✅ Proper accumulation of tournament fees and royalties.
- ✅ Handling of treasury funds for winning guilds.
- ✅ Locking treasuries of non-winning guilds.
- ✅ Fair distribution of earnings among guild members.
- ✅ Incentivizing the purchase of Champions from guilds with large treasuries.
- ✅ Controlling Anima distribution when a guild's treasury exceeds set thresholds.

#### **6. Royalty Distribution Tests**
- ✅ Simulating NFT Champion purchases and royalty allocation.
- ✅ Ensuring fair distribution between Oracle, Guilds, Champions, Choices, and Skins.
- ✅ Governance-approved royalty modification.
- ✅ Verifying 90% royalty redirection to the next tournament treasury and 10% to the creator.
- ✅ Ensuring safeguards against unfair distribution.

#### **7. Security Tests**
- ✅ Ensuring only authorized roles can execute restricted functions.
- ✅ Simulating unauthorized fund withdrawals.
- ✅ Preventing duplicate tournament registrations.
- ✅ Reentrancy attack protection for fund withdrawal functions.
- ✅ Guarding against integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities.
- ✅ Preventing front-running attacks in tournaments and governance.
- ✅ Sybil attack simulations to detect potential vote manipulation.
- ✅ Comprehensive event logging for system transparency.

#### **8. Gas Optimization Tests**
- ✅ Measuring gas costs for minting NFTs.
- ✅ Evaluating tournament entry fee costs.
- ✅ Analyzing tournament performance under high registration loads.
- ✅ Optimizing on-chain calls to minimize costs.
- ✅ Determining the need for batching operations (e.g., prize distribution).

### The Road Ahead
Testing will be a meticulous process, and I anticipate encountering **unexpected bugs and edge cases**. However, ensuring the contract is **secure, efficient, and fully functional** before deploying it on a real network is crucial.

If you have insights, feedback, or want to contribute to the testing process, let’s connect—I truly appreciate any support in making SCA a **robust and fair** ecosystem!

Stay tuned for the results of the first test runs!
